# PSL Info Project
<p> <b>PSL Info Project</b> is my first semester project regarding Python programming. It helps me a lot to solve complex programs using python. It was a great experience working on it. I use <b>Tkinter</b> and <b>MySQL</b> to graphically design it and store information in database for ticket reservation respectively. It features you to have information regarding all PSL players (their personal information, their career and their country), PSL teams staff (including all coaches, trainers, and their home grounds as well), teams information (their overall cricket and trophy winners). It reserves tickets online as well and store their information at backend in database. You can reserve tickets, return tickets, check your bill card as well.</p>
